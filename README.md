# Python1To100

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python scripts numbered from 1 to 100, each demonstrating a unique concept, algorithm, or exercise in Python programming.

## File List

Below is a list of files currently in the `main` branch:

```plaintext
Python1To100/
├── 01_example.py
├── 02_example.py
├── 03_example.py
...
├── 100_example.py
├── README.md
```

> **Note:** Replace `01_example.py`, `02_example.py`, etc., with the actual filenames present in your repository.

## How to Use

- Browse through the numbered Python files to explore different programming concepts.
- Each file is self-contained and can be run independently.
- To run a script, use:
    ```bash
    python <filename.py>
    ```
